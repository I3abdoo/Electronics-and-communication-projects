• Aim of the project:
  In this project we are changing the idea of traditional car parking to create
  a system that makes the process of finding and parking in a parking
  spot more efficient and convenient for drivers.
  The project typically involves the use of technology, such as sensors,
  cameras, and software, to automate and optimize the parking process.
  It also can be used for reducing the time it takes for drivers to find an
  available parking spot by providing real-time information on parking
  availability through a mobile app or other means.
  Reducing traffic congestion and emissions by minimizing the time
  spent by drivers searching for parking spots and circling around
  parking spot and preventing unauthorized parking lot.
• List of the used components:
  - ESP32 Development Kit (Wi-Fi and Bluetooth).
  - 5 IR infrared sensors.
  - Servo Motor.
  - 5V Power Source.
